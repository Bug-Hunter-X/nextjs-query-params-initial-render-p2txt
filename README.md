# Next.js Query Parameter Bug
This repository demonstrates a common issue in Next.js applications: accessing query parameters before they are available.  This can result in rendering errors if not handled correctly.

## The Problem
The `useRouter` hook in Next.js provides access to the route's query parameters. However, these parameters might not be immediately available when the component first renders. Attempting to access them before they are populated can lead to `undefined` values being used, causing unexpected behavior (like displaying nothing, or an error).

## The Solution
The solution is to conditionally render the content that depends on the query parameters, ensuring that they have values before usage.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install`.
4. Run `npm run dev`.
5. Observe the initial render.  The 'id' parameter will be undefined causing a brief period of nothing shown.
6. Navigate to a route with a query parameter (e.g., `/my-route?id=123`).
7. Observe that the component now correctly displays the query parameter value.

This demonstrates the race condition of rendering before query parameters have been fetched.
